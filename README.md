# ResourceMonitorExample

A simple example app for the ResourceMonitor gem.

Postgres has been added in order to allow ActiveRecord expansion in the future.

Should only require a local redis instance for ActionCable.

The gem's Github repo is here https://github.com/WriteCodeEveryday/resource_monitor.
